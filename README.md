# FerrenaBulkRNAseq
Pipeline for analysis of bulkRNAseq data


This goes through bulkRNAseq data anlysis with helpful basic functions for comparative Differential Expression (DE) analysis and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis(GSEA). DE testing uses DESeq2 and GSEA uses FGSEA. Plotting is a big part of this package and relies on ggplot2 and the general tidyverse suite.
